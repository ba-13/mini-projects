# Assignment 1

You have now learnt the basics of version control using GitHub and git and also some basics of bash script. Now its time to implement some of the things you have learnt and also try some new things.

Here are some resources to help you:

1. For GitHub:
   * [An Intro to Git and GitHub for Beginners](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)
   * [git - the simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
   * **Just Google it dude**

2. For Bash Commands:
   * [Basic Linux Commands for Beginners](https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners)
   * [35 Linux Basic Commands Every User Should Know](https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/linux-commands)

The Above resources should suffice for now.

## Problem Statement

1. In the repository you had created in the tutorial *(If you havent just create one repo now and clone it)*:
   * Switch to a new branch `merge/A` and create a new file `github_testing.txt`.
   * Now add a few lines of text(anyting you want) to this txt file and push it to this branch.
   * Switch to another new branch `merge/B` and make some changes(rewrite some stuff) to the txt file created earlier and push the changes to this branch.
   * Now merge `merge/B` into `merge/A` and try to resolve any issues if any. 

2. In the Y20 Induction repo you have forked in the `Assignments/Assignment1` add a few screenshots of any issues you had encountered while doing the above and also create a `solution.txt` containing any links you referred to while solving the above issues *(create this txt file regardless of if you referred any link or not)*. Now open a `Pull Request` following the steps in the main [README.md](https://github.com/AerialRobotics-IITK/InductionY20/blob/main/README.md).
