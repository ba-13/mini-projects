# Flash Baron

A simple application that acts as flash cards, given words and its definitions.

To use, run `install.sh`, or if on Windows, run the commands in install.sh
This will create `./dist/flash_baron` which you can directly run.

To access it in your menu bar, shift `flash_baron.desktop` to
`~/.local/share/applications/` and `flash-card.png` to `~/.local/share/icons/`.

Either make `flash_baron` executable accessible user-wide by adding in PATH, or
give the exact executable path inside `flash_baron.desktop` in `Exec` attribute.
